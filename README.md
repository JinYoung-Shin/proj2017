Multi-Connectivity in Edge Computing Using RNN Algorithm

Abstract

	As number of devices which need network increase. Necessity of new technology for managing massive connectivity came to light. This research adopts Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) algorithm to manage multi connectivity. Research develops the most ideal algorithm by strict analysis. And the developed method is going to be applied on network managing hub combined with LPWAN(Low-Power Wide Area Network) based connectivity managing technology. Selection and application of best fit method by dealing with kinds of RNN algorithm, we expect gaining outstanding performance on network management. And the performance would lead popularization of edge computing.
